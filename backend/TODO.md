# To-Do:
- [X] Create collection with rooms
    - Generated alphanumeric/word-based? ID
    - Participants (Array)
        - Generated/chosen name
        - IP address?
        - Unique ID
    - Current video (details TBD)
    - Playlist contents (details TBD)
- [X] Creating a room:
    - Create a new room in the database
    - Navigate to `/room/{id}`
    - Create websocket to `/ws/room/{id}`
- [ ] Start a video
    - Client who requests the video sends a message to `/ws/room/{id}`: `{"event": "AddVideo", "url": "http://example.com"}` (details TBD)
    - Server adds video to room's playlist, sets the `currentEntry` property
    - Server does preparations (fetch video if necessary?)
    - Server sends WS message to all room participats: `{"type": "StartVideo", "serverTime": 1234567}` (details TBD)
    - Clients periodically send their current video position to the server to make sure they stay in sync
- [ ] Pinging logic (client)
    - Keep track of current video time in `state` (with video element event handler)
    - Start a timer (once every second?) to send a `ping` message with the current client time to the server
    - If the server replies with a `serverTime`, adjust current video position to the server position
