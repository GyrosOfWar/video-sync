# To-Do:
- [ ] Creating a room:
    - Create a new room in the database (`POST /api/rooms`)
    - Navigate to `/room/{id}`
    - Create websocket to `/ws/room/{id}`
    - Send `JoinRoomRequest` message as JSON
- [ ] Start a video
    - Send a request to `POST /api/rooms/{id}/video` with some data about the video (mostly just the URL?)
    - OR: Send a Websocket message with the video URL
    - Server sends WS message to all room participats: `{"type": "StartVideo", "serverTime": 1234567}` (details TBD)
    - Clients periodically send their current video position to the server to make sure they stay in sync
- [ ] Pinging logic (client)
    - Keep track of current video time in `state` (with video element event handler)
    - Start a timer (once every 5 seconds?) to send a `ping` message with the current client time to the server
    - If the server replies with a `serverTime`, adjust current video position to the server position
    - The server should be the source of truth for the actual position of the video (I think).
